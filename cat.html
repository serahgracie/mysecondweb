<P> To become like an eagle we have to go through very many hard tasks.like an eagle when it ages it moves in stages for some time it flies up so high in the sky ,it even goes higher than the clouds where it goes to she of its talons . It also needs to shed its beak so it hits its beak on stone can you even imagine how painful it is and it feels ? but at long last it comes out so beautiful after undergoing the pain . i can love to be an eagle.the lion once said i cannot eat grass inn the jungle its not pride but i know what am meant to be "THE KING OF THE JUNGLE
